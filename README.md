### Hi there. I'm @girardiricardo (Ricardo Girardi, a.k.a Girardi) ðŸ‘‹

I'm software developer from Brazil. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

When I was 8 I started creating websites to spend money on online games, since spending our parent's money on online games was not as common as it is nowadays ðŸ˜‚. I started working with HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP to develop the websites. Photoshop, Fireworks, and Dreamweaver for prototyping. But I never thought that it will be my career in the future.

I also had a YouTube channel where I taught some tips and software usage.

I started my technology career when I was 18. I've always liked front-end but in the last years, I have taken deep on back-end, infrastructure, patterns, and architecture, since today my main role is to solve problems.

I've been studying online for a long while and I'm a self-learning. But, I have studied Information Systems for 2 years at Universidade Positivo and now I have been studying System Development at FIAP University.

I like to be useful, solve big challenges and teach people.

I'm currently working with:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- React
- Python
- Java
- Elixir
- SQL
- GraphQL
- Kubernetes
- Docker
- AWS
- AI
